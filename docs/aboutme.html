        <p>I think the most significant challenge was learning how to code with XML and HTML! I’m
            still not sure how to use XML. Pushing for HTML can have </p>
        <p>Working with HTML/GitHub has a creative advantage. There is full control over color
            schemes and fonts. To a new website learner, WordPress is way more simple. Adding images
            and text is a simple drag and drop.</p>
        <p>HTML was quite hard to work with, in my opinion. If there wasn’t one problem, there was
            always another. Pushing everything on to GitHub wasn’t simple and I ran into a lot of
            errors.</p>
        <p>I ran into difficulty trying to figure out how the navigation bar works for WordPress. It
            wasn’t intuitive, but after figuring it out once it was easy.</p>
        <p>Unironically reading is a very important skill to have. Taking instructions at face value
            was confusing. Being patient and reading everything made things much easier.</p>

            out that would make my website look better.</p>
